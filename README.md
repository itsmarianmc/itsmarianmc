<!-- About -->
<p align="center">
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <span>I am itsmarian, I'm a front and Backend website developer and active Minecraft player and I have my own Minecraft project in which I invest a lot of time. For this project I also run, manage and design a website as a hobby and for learning purposes. I create the websites to develop myself and to constantly expand my knowledge about websites, HTML, CSS, JavaScript in fields of frontend and backend. Among other things, I use artificial intelligence to test its limits and to help myself in tough situations in which I do not know further.</span>

			<h3>Projekt City [by SuffixHD & itsmarian]</h3>
			<span>Projekt City is a unique and expansive Minecraft project that operates without funding and is entirely free to play for everyone. Our mission is to develop an easily navigable Minecraft world for everyone, while paying a lot of attention to details and flawless work. Within "Projekt City," we are constructing a large map that features a city, an airport, a hotel, and much more, with meticulous attention to detail and precision.</span>
